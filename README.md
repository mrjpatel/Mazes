# Mazes
This project was a part of university assignment. Where we used different algorithms to genertae the square or hexagon mazes and solve it.

## Algorithms used
- **Generate Mazes**
    - Prim's Algorithm
    - Recursive back tracking
- **Solve the Mazes**
    - Wall Follower
    - Bidirectional Recursive Backtracker

## Compile the program
javac -cp .:mazeSolver/SampleSolver.jar *.java

## Run the program:
java -cp .:mazeSolver/SampleSolver.jar MazeTester inputFilename n
